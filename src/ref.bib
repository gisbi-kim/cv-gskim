    ABSTRACT ={This paper introduces a multimodal range dataset namely for radio
    detection and ranging (radar) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR)
    specifically targeting the urban environment. By extending our workshop
    paper to a larger scale, this dataset focuses on the range sensor-based
    place recognition and provides 6D baseline trajectories of a vehicle for
    place recognition ground truth. Provided radar data support both raw-level
    and image-format data, including a set of time-stamped 1D intensity arrays and
    360 polar images, respectively. In doing so, we provide flexibility between
    raw data and image data depending on the purpose of the research. Unlike
    existing datasets, our focus is at capturing both temporal and structural
    diversities for range-based place recognition research. For evaluation,
    we applied and validated that our previous location descriptor and its search
    algorithm are highly effective for radar place recognition method. Furthermore,
    the result shows that radar-based place recognition outperforms LiDAR-based one
    exploiting its longer-range measurements. The dataset is available from

    ABSTRACT = {Learning-based ego-motion estimation approaches have recently
    drawn strong interest from researchers, mostly focusing on visual
    perception. A few learning-based approaches using Light Detection and
    Ranging (LiDAR) have been re- ported; however, they heavily rely on a
    supervised learning manner. Despite the meaningful performance of these ap-
    proaches, supervised training requires ground-truth pose labels, which is
    the bottleneck for real-world applications. Differing from these approaches,
    we focus on unsupervised learning for LiDAR odometry (LO) without trainable
    labels. Achieving trainable LO in an unsupervised manner, we introduce the
    uncertainty-aware loss with geometric confidence, thereby al- lowing the
    reliability of the proposed pipeline. Evaluation on the KITTI, Complex
    Urban, and Oxford RobotCar datasets demon- strate the prominent performance
    of the proposed method compared to conventional model-based methods. The
    proposed method shows a comparable result against SuMa (in KITTI), LeGO-LOAM
    (in Complex Urban), and Stereo-VO (in Oxford RobotCar). The video and
    extra-information of the paper are described in
    https://sites.google.com/view/deeplo.},
