# Giseop KIM (ÍπÄÍ∏∞ÏÑ≠)

## Summary 
- I am a **SLAM researcher/engineer**. My research interests are state estimation and 3D perception for autonomous robots.
- My main research topic during the Ph.D. has been focused on **robust 3D mapping in complex urban sites using LiDAR sensors**. 
- I have experience in **a full pipeline of SLAM** in the real world (e.g., from sensor fusion, calibration, odometry, place retrieval, pose-graph optimization, multi-session localization, to long-term map management).
